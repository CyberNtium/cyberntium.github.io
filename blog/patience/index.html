It is difficult to want to lash out in anger at someone you do not have any respect for, but not doing it is even more difficult. In our lives, we met a lot of different people, some good, some bad. But, the common thing that we all have towards one another is mutual respect. However, in this current era, it seems to me that we have slowly swayed away from that mutual understanding. People no longer treat each other with respect. We used to help one another out, build trust based on rapport. Now, it is every man for himself/herself. What happened?">

<p>It is difficult to want to lash out in anger at someone you do not have any respect for, but not doing it is even more difficult. In our lives, we met a lot of different people, some good, some bad. But, the common thing that we all have towards one another is mutual respect. However, in this current era, it seems to me that we have slowly swayed away from that mutual understanding. People no longer treat each other with respect. We used to help one another out, build trust based on rapport. Now, it is every man for himself/herself. What happened?</p>
<p>Well, this is a blog, not an essay repository, so you probably understand where I am going with this. I am not a saint, nor a good person. I understand that I might be an asshole as I don&rsquo;t really mince my words towards anyone I met. However, what I say remains a truth, regardless of whether it is correct or not. After all, truths are subjective. Therefore, I am very vocal and expressive towards people that I despise. But, that is not a reason for me to not respect them. You see, we can disgree with a person who bad-mouthed our parents, but we can still respect that person as a human being. I won&rsquo;t just treat him/her like a subhhuman just because he/she said my mother is a whore or whatever. For the DC fans out there, it&rsquo;s what Superman would do. And for the anime fans out there, it&rsquo;s what Himmel would have done. Therefore, it takes a lot of patience and understanding to still treat a person with respect regardless of how terrible that person turns out to be.</p>
