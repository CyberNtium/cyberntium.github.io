I really wonder what people have in mind when they first became motivated to make their own blog/portfolio website.
Do people do it for fun? Or do people do it just to show off their full stack skills?
Or maybe it&rsquo;s because they saw someone else on LinkedIn doing it so now they felt left behind.
Regardless, I don&rsquo;t think any of those is a sin in itself.
We live in the era of vibe-coding, the skill expression from developing something from the ground up is somehow ruined. Even for me, I rely on AI way too much for my own good.">

<p>I really wonder what people have in mind when they first became motivated to make their own blog/portfolio website.<br>
Do people do it for fun? Or do people do it just to show off their full stack skills?<br>
Or maybe it&rsquo;s because they saw someone else on LinkedIn doing it so now they felt left behind.</p>
<p>Regardless, I don&rsquo;t think any of those is a sin in itself.
We live in the era of vibe-coding, the skill expression from developing something from the ground up is somehow ruined. Even for me, I rely on AI way too much for my own good.</p>
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;m going to rely on it lesser, by continuing with this site. I will document some of my learning journeys of various different courses. Even if there is no one reading them, I know it will be good for me,<br>
it <strong>has to</strong>.</p>
